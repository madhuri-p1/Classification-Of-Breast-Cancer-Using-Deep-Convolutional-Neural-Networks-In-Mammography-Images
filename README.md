1.Implemented a project framework for breast cancer classification in mammograms, distinguishing between
benign and malignant cases.

2. Implemented ResNet-50, a state-of-the-art CNN model, for feature extraction& five classifiers (KNN, SVM, RFC,
Ada-Boost, XGB) to distinguish between benign and malignant images.

3. Achieved superior performance compared to other models on the same dataset, boasting an impressive
accuracy rate of 87%.
