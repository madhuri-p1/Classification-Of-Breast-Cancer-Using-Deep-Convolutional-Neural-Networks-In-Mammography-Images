# Classification-Of-Breast-Cancer-Using-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-In-Mammography-Images

Our objective is to classify breast cancer using appropriate Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) techniques. The Methodology used in the current study that classify the presence of breast
cancer or not using Kaggle data which includes digital mammography images with associated clinical
data that was created exclusively for the development and testing of algorithms and systems for the early
identification and diagnosis of breast cancer. Images from the DDSM (Digital Database for Screening
Mammography) and CBIS-DDSM datasets are included in this dataset.
